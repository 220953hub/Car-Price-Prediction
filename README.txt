# Car Price Prediction 🚗💰  
A Machine Learning project that predicts the price of a car based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more.  

## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques to estimate the selling price of a used car. The model is trained on a dataset containing historical car sales data and can help buyers and sellers make informed decisions.  

## 🔍 Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing price distribution, correlations, and feature importance.  
- **Model Training**: Implementing multiple ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model performance using techniques like Grid Search and Randomized Search.  
- **Web App (Optional)**: Deploying the model using Flask/Streamlit for user-friendly predictions.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost  
- **Framework (Optional)**: Flask/Streamlit  
- **Deployment**: Heroku/Streamlit Cloud  

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset contains the following key attributes:  
- Car brand & model  
- Year of manufacture  
- Mileage (in km/miles)  
- Fuel type (Petrol, Diesel, Electric, etc.)  
- Transmission type (Manual, Automatic)  
- Engine size  
- Selling price  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction.git
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the model:  
   ```bash
   python model.py
   ```
4. (Optional) Run the web app:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 📈 Results  
- Model performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE, R² Score, and MAE.  
- Feature importance analysis to understand the key factors affecting car prices.
